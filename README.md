# TaskManager
 
A simple Task Manager web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to add tasks with unique titles and descriptions. Each task has a default status of "incomplete," and users can dynamically update the status to "complete" or vice versa. The interface is clean and user-friendly, providing an easy way to manage and track tasks.
